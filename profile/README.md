# Hi frikis! ðŸ‘‹

We are pleased to have you here. Currently we are a very small (really small) group of very capable technical professionals with the intention of working and testing some 
entrepreneurial ideas in order to go to market and be profitable sometime in our lives.
## ðŸš€ Our goal

To be able to place ourselves in a sufficiently stable and profitable market. will we fail? will we give up? With time it will be known, the important thing is that everyone here is 
looking for a purpose in life, a "game changer" that gives us a real reason to keep going. We seek stability and happiness.
